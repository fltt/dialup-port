Dial-Up Utilities example files
===============================
This directory contain sample files for the `linkup` script and the
"ppp" driver.

Linkup and linkdown scripts
---------------------------
The `linkup` example script shows how to write a user `linkup` script:
it should contain commands that the user can run.
If the commands must be run as `root`, put them in the system's `linkup`
(and `linkdown`) scripts.

Copy it into $HOME/.config/%%PORTNAME%%/ and edit it.
If you need to run commands when the connection is torn down, put them
into a `linkdown` script.

NOTE: These files must have the executable permission set.

The ppp driver
--------------
To use the "ppp" driver, ppp(8) must be aptly configured.

Three example files are provided: ppp.conf, ppp.linkup and ppp.linkdown.
Copy them into /etc/ppp, then edit them.

NOTE: The files should be owned by root:network and have mode 640
      (readable and writeable by root, readable only by network group
      members).

The following constraints must be satisfied in order for the "ppp"
driver to work.

ppp.conf must contain the following entries:

- set-modem-N, for a few values of N, starting from 0: how many entries
  create, depends on how many network adapter devices you intend to use
  at the same time
- disable-dns and enable-dns: you shouldn't modify nor delete these
  entries

Moreover, for each SIM profile defined in %%ETCDIR%%/profiles, a
corresponding configuration entry must be present in ppp.conf,
ppp.linkup and ppp.linkdown.

NOTE: If you don't need to do anything special when the connection is
      brought up or torn down, you can delete both ppp.linkup and
      ppp.linkdown.

Apart form these constraints, anything said in the ppp(8) man page
applies.
